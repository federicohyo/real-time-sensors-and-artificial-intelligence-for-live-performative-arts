# Strange Attractors

I've always thought that strange attractors were fascinating and beautiful, but
I never had an opportunity to study them during my undergrad (for some reason
the class on dynamical systems never had enough registered students to justify
running it). I also always wanted to get more experience with C++ and the
openFrameworks toolkit, so this seemed like a great side project to exercise
whatever remains of my math chops while pretending that I'm doing something
artistic.

The currently supported attractors are:
- [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)
- []

## Method
I'm currently using [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)
to approximate the evolution of these attractors.
