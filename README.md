# real-time-sensors-and-artificial-intelligence-for-live-performative-arts

This repository contains the material for the LPM 2024 workshop: https://avnode.net/learnings/real-time-sensors-and-artificial-intelligence-for-live-performative-arts/

This workshop aims to empower live performers and art practitioners with the skills to integrate various sensors for creating live demonstrations of real-time sensor data for creative coding applications. Participants will learn to collect data from various sensors (using standard protocols such as USB and serial communication), visualize the real-time data stream, and employ pretrained neural networks for insightful data analysis, data augmentation, and creative applications. The framework and software used are OpenFrameworks (https://openframeworks.cc/) and C/C++.

WORKSHOP FORMAT: Interactive, project-based learning. Emphasis on collaboration among participants of varying skill levels to address different learning curves.
